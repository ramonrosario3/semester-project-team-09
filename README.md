# BoriTuri 

The BoriTuri project consists of a service where people can find locations of interest for tourism and engage with local businesses. The project will be completed by December 5, 2021.  This will be accomplished by incentivizing people to discover and visit different tourist locations or businesses, via a mobile software platform. The main method of incentive will be via gamification of said software platform, where individuals are rewarded for visiting places in Puerto Rico.
